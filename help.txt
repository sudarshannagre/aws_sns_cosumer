Spring Boot + AWS SNS Consumer.

Note : Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) sends notifications two ways, A2A and A2P. 
	A2A provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. 
	These applications include Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, and other HTTPS endpoints. 
	A2P functionality lets you send messages to your customers with SMS texts, push notifications, and email. 

How to Run : 
1. Deploy this application on any AWS services like ECS, EC2
2. Make public/accessible end point of this project.
3. Provide you public end point as subscriber to the SNS Topic so that SNS topic can send notification to your end point which is configured inside the controller.
4. SNS Topic must be created before the step 3.
